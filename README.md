**PrionPredictorDB** is a scalable and organism-independent pipeline and database for the prediction of prion-like, aggregation-prone proteins using both **sequence** and **structure-based** methods. This project integrates tools like **PLAAC**, **AlphaFold**, **Aggrescan3D**, and **DBSCAN** to identify and cluster potentially pathogenic prion-like domains (PRDs) across any organism's proteome.

---

## Highlights

- Analyzed the complete **human proteome (~20,000 proteins)** using PLAAC to identify **195 PRD-containing proteins**.
- Retrieved **AlphaFold structures** for 188 proteins and computed:
  - **Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA)**
  - **Average pLDDT** scores
- Identified aggregation-prone PRDs using:
  - **Aggrescan3D** to score individual residues
  - **DBSCAN** to cluster aggregation-prone residues in 3D
- Developed a **command-line tool** to run the entire pipeline on any FASTA proteome.
- ðŸ–¥Built a full-stack **web application** with a ReactJS frontend, NGLViewer for structure rendering, and MongoDB backend.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. **PRD Detection (PLAAC)**
- Input: Human proteome FASTA (UniProt)
- Output: 195 proteins with valid prion-like domains (PRDs)

### 2. **Structure Retrieval and Filtering**
- Tool: [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)
- Filters:
  - **SASA > 1000 Ã…Â²**
  - **Average pLDDT < 50**
- Result: 188 proteins passed structure availability and thresholding

Absolutely â€” here's an updated version of the **DBSCAN-related section** in the README, now including the **biological rationale** for why 3D clustering of aggregation-prone residues matters:


### 3. Aggregation Propensity and 3D Clustering

To identify realistic aggregation hotspots within prion-like domains (PRDs), we implemented a **structure-aware aggregation pipeline**:

#### Steps:

* **Tool:** [Aggrescan3D](http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/A3D/) computes per-residue aggregation propensity scores using AlphaFold structures.
* For each protein:

  * **Select residues within the PRD** that have **Aggrescan3D score > 0.5**
  * Apply **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)** to identify **3D clusters** of spatially close, aggregation-prone residues.

#### Biological Rationale for 3D Clustering:

Aggregation is a **structural phenomenon**, not just a sequence-level one. Simply having aggregation-prone residues is not enough â€” they must be **spatially close in the folded protein** to nucleate aggregation. Here's why clustering is important:

* **Spatial Proximity Matters:**
  Aggregation typically starts at **hotspots** where multiple aggregation-prone residues come **together in 3D**, forming a nucleation seed. These hotspots are more predictive of **actual aggregation** than isolated high-scoring residues.

* **Filters Out False Positives:**
  Some residues may score high individually but be buried inside the protein or far apart. 3D clustering ensures only **physically plausible aggregation regions** are considered.

* **Mimics Real Prion Nucleation:**
  Structural studies of prions (e.g., Tau, Î±-synuclein) show that **small structured cores** initiate fibril formation. DBSCAN helps emulate this by identifying **compact residue clusters** within PRDs.

* **Therapeutic Relevance:**
  3D clusters can be **targeted** by small molecules or antibodies. Identifying these clusters helps in **rational drug design** aimed at blocking aggregation.

> ðŸ“Œ In summary: DBSCAN-based 3D clustering enables a **more biologically accurate**, **structurally informed**, and **therapeutically useful** prediction of aggregation hotspots.

## Biological Relevance

* **Prion-like domains (PLDs)** are disordered regions enriched in Q/N residues and implicated in **neurodegenerative diseases** like ALS and Alzheimerâ€™s.
* Aggregation-prone PLDs are often overlooked due to structural disorder. Combining **PLAAC**, **structure-based filtering**, and **residue clustering** helps refine high-confidence candidates.
* Your dataset and framework can aid in **target discovery** for drug design or genetic studies.
